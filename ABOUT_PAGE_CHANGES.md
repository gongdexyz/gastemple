# About Page - Hackathon Version Changes

## Summary
Updated the About page from "casual meme coin" narrative to "serious hackathon project with SKR rescue mission" while maintaining the edgy, technical tone.

## Key Changes

### 1. Hero Section (WTF IS THIS SH*T?)
**Before:** "I'm just an AI video guy making a copium dispenser"
**After:** 
- CN: "为了拯救 $SKR 社区做的黑客松项目"
- EN: "Solana Hackathon project to save the $SKR community"
- Highlights: 100% revenue → buyback & burn $SKR
- Emphasizes: Fair launch, no presale, no VC

### 2. Tokenomics Section
**Removed:**
- "Dev bag: 2 SOL (I'm broke)"
- "Trust me bro™" audit badge

**Added:**
- **SKR Buyback** (highlighted with yellow border):
  - 100% revenue → Buy & Burn $SKR
  - Creates deflationary flywheel
- **Audit**: Changed to "Hackathon Build" + "Open source on GitHub"

- **Phase 3: EMPOWER** - Keep buying & burning SKR, expand features
